## Provenance and update frequency

At this moment GeoJSON dumps are experimental, low quality: using `http://polygons.openstreetmap.fr/get_geojson.py?id={osm_relation_id}`, 
where no update or quality guarantees are offered. 
No [data provenance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lineage#Data_Provenance) metadata or report about simplification methods. 
See also reported bug at [issue #34](https://github.com/datasets-br/city-codes/issues/34).

## Licence

All OSM dumps are OSM data or derived, so ODbL  licensed,       http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0
